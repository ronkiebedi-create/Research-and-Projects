## Featured Research & Projects

### **Ising Model — Monte Carlo Simulation**
2D Ising model implemented with the Metropolis algorithm. Computed magnetisation, energy, susceptibility, and specific heat across temperatures, identifying the phase transition and comparing with theoretical predictions.  

---

### **Tacoma Bridge / TSP — Structural & Algorithmic Modelling**  
Numerical investigation of oscillations/stability (Tacoma Bridge) and route-optimisation algorithms (TSP / simulated annealing) to study dynamic systems and optimisation problems relevant to theoretical and computational physics.  

---

### **Zener Diode Characterisation**
Analysed breakdown behaviour, voltage regulation, and temperature dependence through experimental data and modelling.  

---

### **Quantum Computing & AI Integration (Review Paper)**
Independent review synthesising 15+ studies on quantum algorithms and their applications in AI. Selected for presentation at the **IIPA National Conference 2025**.
